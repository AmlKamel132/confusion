# Confusion

- Simple Angular Application  
- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.
- This Project depends on / related exercises and my assignments at Coursera Angular Course 


# Notes
 - starting from exercise12 we will use json-server which provides a very simple way to set up a web server that supports a REST API server.
   - install json-server ```  npm install json-server -g ``` 
   -  i added folder called json-server.zip .. you can decompress it and use it .. ( move it away from confusion project )
   - go to your folder and run  ``` json-server --watch db.json -d 2000 ``` 
   - it should be like image after run ```json-server --watch db.json -d 2000 ```   ![server-json](/server-json-img.png)
   

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
