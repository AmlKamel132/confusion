# Confusion

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.
- This Project depends on / related exercises and my assignments at coursera angular course 


# Notes
 - starting from exercise12 we will use json-server which provides a very simple way to set up a web server that supports a REST API server.
   - install json-server ```  npm install json-server -g ``` 
   -  i added folder called json-server.zip .. you can decompress it and use it .. ( move it away from confusion project )
   - go to your folder and run  ``` json-server --watch db.json -d 2000 ```
